# Changelog

All notable changes to Sigil are recorded here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the workspace uses a
single SemVer version across all crates. Full release notes for tagged releases
also appear under [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ju571nK/sigil/releases).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`sigil-mcp` local mode — individual self-assessment, no server** (#55).
  When `SIGIL_SERVER_BASE_URL` is unset, `sigil-mcp` reads the local
  `sigil-agent` control socket instead of a fleet read API and exposes *this
  machine's* AI Guard posture as three read-only MCP tools — `my_risk`,
  `my_guard_detail`, `my_findings`. Mode is auto-detected; the control wire
  types moved to `sigil-core::control_proto` so the MCP client and the agent
  share one contract.
- **Dedicated `sigil` system group/user + `root:sigil` ownership** (#10 slice 1,
  closes #4). Declarative `sysusers.d`/`tmpfiles.d` create the `sigil`
  group/user and own `/var/lib/sigil`, `/var/log/sigil`, `/run/sigil` as
  `root:sigil 0750`. The agent and sender units run `root:sigil` (`User=root` +
  `Group=sigil`), so the control socket becomes `root:sigil 0660`. The agent
  package applies both at install (deb postinst + rpm scriptlet, guarded and
  idempotent). Foundation for de-rooting the sender/server daemons in later
  slices; the agent stays root for file-integrity monitoring.

### Fixed

- **`sigil-mcp` local-mode socket trust** (#57). The local upstream now verifies
  the control-socket peer is root or the current user (via
  `UnixStream::peer_cred`) before trusting its `DoctorAiGuardReport`, closing a
  local security-telemetry spoofing gap where another user could serve a
  fabricated "all-clear" posture. Returns a distinct `UntrustedPeer` error.
- **`sigil doctor` events-dir check now validates the owner, not just the group**
  (#60). `classify_events_dir_perms` previously checked only group + mode, so a
  dir owned by a non-root user with group `sigil` and mode `0750` was falsely
  reported as `root:sigil`-hardened while that owner could still mutate it. It
  now warns on a non-root owner, mirroring the control-socket classifier.
- **Standalone `sigil-sender` install no longer fails on `Group=sigil`** (#61).
  The sender unit runs `root:sigil`, but the sender package neither created the
  group nor depended on the agent package, so a sender-only install left
  `systemctl enable --now sigil-sender` failing on group credential resolution.
  The sender package now ships and applies the same idempotent
  `sysusers.d`/`tmpfiles.d` `sigil.conf` as the agent package.

### Changed

- `sigil doctor`'s events-directory permission check is refactored around a pure
  `classify_events_dir_perms` classifier (mirrors the existing socket
  classifier) and validates `root:sigil` ownership; behavior is unchanged, the
  decision logic is now unit-tested.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **`sigil-mcp` — read-only fleet MCP server** (#51). Exposes a `sigil-server`'s
  GET read API as Model Context Protocol tools so an MCP client (Claude
  Desktop/Code) can read and reason over fleet posture. Shipped in `install.sh`
  and the prebuilt release archives alongside the other binaries.

_Releases at or before 0.2.0 are documented in
